# 🗂️ File Organizer Script

A simple Bash script that organizes files in a directory into subfolders based on their file extensions.  
Great for cleaning up messy folders like **Downloads** or project directories.

## 📌 Features
- Automatically detects file extensions and sorts files into matching folders.  
- Creates a `noext/` folder for files without an extension.  
- Case-insensitive handling of extensions (`.JPG` → `jpg`).  
- Works on Linux and macOS.
